  <h1>Terms of Use (EULA)</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2025</p>

  <p>These Terms of Use ("Terms") are a legal agreement between you and the developer of <strong>AJID (اجيد)</strong> ("we", "our", or "the app") for your use of the AJID mobile application (the "App"). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

  <h2>1. Use of the App</h2>
  <p>You may use the App only for personal, non-commercial use in accordance with these Terms and with the rules of the Apple App Store or Google Play Store from which you downloaded it. You may not reverse-engineer, copy, resell, or misuse the App or its content in any way that violates law or these Terms.</p>

  <h2>2. Subscriptions and In-App Purchases</h2>
  <p>The App is free to download. We offer an optional in-app purchase ("Remove Ads" / Premium) that can be:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Auto-renewable subscription</strong> (monthly or yearly) – Your subscription renews automatically until you cancel. You can cancel in your device's subscription settings (iOS: Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions; Android: Play Store → Subscriptions). Refunds are handled by Apple or Google according to their policies.</li>
    <li><strong>One-time purchase</strong> (lifetime) – A single payment for permanent access to the "Remove Ads" benefit, with no recurring charges.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Prices and durations are shown in the App before purchase. By completing a purchase, you agree to pay the applicable price and to the applicable store's (Apple or Google) payment terms.</p>

  <h2>3. Disclaimers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Prayer times and Qibla</strong> – Prayer times and Qibla direction are calculated using standard methods and your location. They are for convenience only and are not a substitute for local religious authority. We do not guarantee their accuracy for any specific location or time.</li>
    <li><strong>Health and fitness</strong> – Any health, fitness, or wellness content or tracking in the App is for general information only and is not medical or professional advice. Always consult a qualified professional for health or fitness decisions.</li>
    <li><strong>Islamic content</strong> – Quran, athkar, and other Islamic content are provided for devotional and educational use. Interpretation and religious practice may vary; we do not take a position on scholarly differences.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>The App, its design, and its original content (excluding third-party content such as Quran text or recitations) are owned by us or our licensors. You do not acquire any ownership rights by using the App. Quran and other licensed content remain subject to their respective licences.</p>

  <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, the App is provided "as is". We are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages, or for any loss of data or revenue, arising from your use or inability to use the App. In no event shall our total liability exceed the amount you paid us in the twelve (12) months before the claim (or, if nothing was paid, zero). Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations; in such cases, our liability is limited to the maximum permitted by law.</p>

  <h2>6. Termination</h2>
  <p>You may stop using the App at any time. We may suspend or end your access if you breach these Terms or for any other reason. Upon termination, your right to use the App ceases. Sections that by their nature should survive (e.g. disclaimers, limitation of liability) will survive.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to the App and Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update the App or these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the App after we post updated Terms means you accept the new Terms. If you do not agree, you must stop using the App. For material changes, we may notify you in the App or via the contact information you have provided.</p>

  <h2>8. Governing Law and Disputes</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Morocco, without regard to conflict-of-law rules. Any dispute arising from these Terms or the App shall be resolved in the courts of that jurisdiction, except where prohibited.</p>

  <h2>9. Contact</h2>
  <p>For questions about these Terms or the App, contact us at: <strong><a href="mailto:eddahbiabdelmajed@gmail.com">eddahbiabdelmajed@gmail.com</a></strong>.</p>
